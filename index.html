			<h1>Cable Boxes</h1>

			<p>Cable boxes come in a few different sizes which is a direct cause of its location. In retrospect this refers to houses (smaller boxes), street poles(usually little bigger), land/area cable boxes (big boxes). These relative sizes a linked with how muh resposinibiltiy the cables/wires have in its relative location. The main purpose of these cable boxes is to connect a vicinity or house to a service provider and without these, we wouldnt actually beable to connect to WI-FI or even use the internet. For more info go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_box_(outside)">Wikipedia.org</a>.</p>

		<h2>Antennas</h2>

		<h4>Antennas are serve are very important purpose in our networking community which is why you will see one on the roof off almost every house. Antennas are used to transmit and recieve signals which is why we are able to use apps like google maps and radios. Without antennas much of what we use to connect to networks wouldnt be possible. For more info go to <a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-an-antenna-definition-uses.html">Study.com</a>.</h4>

			<h1>Manholes</h1>
			
			<p>Manholes are basically another way of making people aware of wires and cables hat run underground whilst also covering them up to avoid any form of damage to the wires (as these days many forms of network connections run through underground cables). Manholes also have the purpose of being 'access points' for electricians, etc. to gracefully clean, adjust or add/attach, etc. cables in a more efficient way. For more info, go to <a href="https://theconstructor.org/practical-guide/manhole-purpose-types-features/36941/">TheContructor.org</a>.</p>
